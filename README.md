![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt">Expenses chart component challenge</a> on Frontent Mentor.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SASS
  - Instead of a regular 7-1 Scss structure (7 folders - 1 main file), in this project i went with a different, more improvised approach in order to avoid unnecessary files because of the size of the project
- Javascript
- Webpack bundler
- Desktop first design
  - I intend to go with the Mobile First approach and i usually do, but due the simplicity of the design i decided to do desktop first this time
